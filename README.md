# Imaging Technique and Coding Technique Exploration

This document presents an exploration of an inspiring imaging technique from the Op Art movement and a complementary coding technique using p5.js to achieve similar visual effects.

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I am inspired by the **Op Art movement**, particularly the work of Bridget Riley. Her geometric patterns and optical illusions create a dynamic sense of movement and depth, captivating viewers by making them perceive motion in static images. This technique is beneficial as it effectively captures attention and evokes curiosity, aligning with the assignment's goal of creating visually impactful designs.

### Why This Technique?

- **Engagement**: The illusion of movement draws viewers in, making them interact with the artwork.
- **Visual Impact**: High contrast and precise geometry create striking visuals.
- **Innovation**: Pushes boundaries of traditional static art, offering fresh perspectives.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To replicate Op Art effects, I will use **generative art techniques** with the p5.js library. This JavaScript framework is ideal for creative coding, allowing for dynamic manipulation of shapes and colors to produce optical illusions. Generative art facilitates the creation of intricate designs with minimal manual effort, achieving the desired visual complexity and motion illusion efficiently.

### How This Coding Technique Helps

- **Dynamic Patterns**: Algorithms generate complex patterns that mimic Op Art's optical effects.
- **Efficiency**: Automates intricate designs, saving time while maintaining quality.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adjustable parameters allow for experimentation with different visual outcomes.

For an example implementation using p5.js, explore projects on [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) or view tutorials on the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/). Here is a link to an example code that demonstrates similar generative art techniques: [Example Code](https://editor.p5js.org/).
